# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

The AI Chatbot is a sophisticated multi-model conversational application built with Next.js and the Vercel AI SDK. It provides users with various AI-powered capabilities including text generation, reasoning, image creation, code generation, document creation, and specialized tools like weather information.

The application leverages Azure OpenAI models and integrates with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of chat history and user data. It features a modern, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## 5. User Experience Flow

### 5.1 Chat Experience

1. **Initial Interaction**
   - User logs in to the application
   - User is presented with chat history or option to start a new chat
   - User can select visibility (public/private) for the chat

2. **Model Selection**
   - User can select from available models:
     - Regular chat model (default)
     - Reasoning model (shows thinking process)
     - Other specialized models

3. **Conversation Flow**
   - User enters text or uploads files
   - AI processes the input based on selected model
   - Response is streamed in real-time with smooth word-by-word display
   - For reasoning model, the thinking process is visible

4. **Content Generation**
   - User can request various content types:
     - Text responses (default)
     - Code with syntax highlighting
     - Images through prompts
     - Documents with formatting

5. **Tool Usage**
   - Weather information: User can ask about weather and receive visual cards
   - Document creation: AI can create structured documents
   - Content suggestions: AI can provide content improvement ideas

6. **Feedback Loop**
   - User can continue the conversation based on AI response
   - User can provide feedback on responses
   - Chat history is saved automatically

### 5.2 Multi-modal Experience

1. **Text Input/Output**
   - Primary interaction method
   - Supports markdown formatting
   - Code syntax highlighting

2. **Image Generation**
   - User provides text description
   - AI generates relevant images
   - Images are displayed inline in the chat

3. **Code Generation**
   - User describes coding requirements
   - AI generates code with proper formatting
   - Syntax highlighting enhances readability

4. **Document Creation**
   - User requests document creation
   - AI generates structured documents
   - Documents can be viewed and edited

5. **Weather Information**
   - User asks about weather for a location
   - AI retrieves weather data
   - Information is displayed in a visual card format
