# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AI Chatbot application. Security is a critical aspect of the application, especially considering the handling of user data, conversations with AI models, and integration with external services.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

The application uses Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js) for secure authentication:

- **JWT-based Sessions**: Secure, encrypted JSON Web Tokens
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **Multiple Auth Providers**: Support for credentials, OAuth, and email authentication
- **Secure Password Handling**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt-ts

### Authorization Controls

- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for regular users and administrators
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only access their own chats and data
- **API Route Protection**: Server-side validation of user sessions before accessing protected routes

### Session Management

- **Secure Cookie Settings**: HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes
- **Session Expiration**: Configurable token lifetime with automatic renewal
- **Session Invalidation**: Ability to invalidate sessions on security events

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

- **Database Encryption**: PostgreSQL column-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of secrets and API keys
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for user data and chat history

### Data in Transit

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications are encrypted using TLS
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- **API Security**: Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and rate limiting

### Data Handling

- **Minimization**: Collection of only necessary user data
- **Retention Policies**: Clear policies on data retention and deletion
- **Access Controls**: Strict controls on who can access user data

## API Security

### External API Integration

- **Secure API Key Management**: API keys stored as environment variables, never exposed to clients
- **Request Validation**: Validation of all incoming and outgoing API requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse through rate limiting

### Azure OpenAI Integration

- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted communication with Azure OpenAI services
- **Token Management**: Careful handling of API tokens and keys
- **Request Sanitization**: Cleaning and validation of user inputs before sending to AI services

## Code Security

### Secure Coding Practices

- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

### Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: Regular code scanning for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitoring of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Security Reviews**: Periodic security reviews of the codebase

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment Security

- **Vercel Platform Security**: Leveraging Vercel's secure infrastructure
- **Environment Isolation**: Separation of development, staging, and production environments
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Minimal permissions for service accounts and processes

### Network Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Appropriate firewall configurations
- **Network Isolation**: Proper network segmentation
- **DDoS Protection**: Measures to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks

## Compliance and Privacy

### Data Privacy

- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations integrated into the development process
- **User Consent**: Clear mechanisms for obtaining user consent
- **Data Access**: User ability to access and delete their own data

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR Considerations**: Features to support General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **CCPA Alignment**: California Consumer Privacy Act considerations
- **Industry Standards**: Adherence to industry security standards and best practices

## Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- **Audit Trails**: Maintenance of audit trails for security investigations

### Incident Handling

- **Response Plan**: Defined process for handling security incidents
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Clear process for reporting and addressing vulnerabilities
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Learning from security incidents to improve security posture

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

### Environment Variables

Ensure all sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables:

```
# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
AUTH_URL=<your-auth-url>
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true

# Database
POSTGRES_URL=<your-postgres-connection-string>

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=<api-version>
AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME=<your-resource-name>

# Other API Keys
AZURE_IMAGE_API_KEY=<your-image-api-key>
```

### Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All API keys and secrets are stored securely
- [ ] Authentication is properly configured
- [ ] Database connection uses TLS encryption
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for API endpoints
- [ ] Input validation is in place for all user inputs
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error handling does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging is configured but does not capture sensitive data

## Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

- Rotate API keys periodically
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Set appropriate permissions and rate limits for API keys

### Authentication Configuration

- Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review active sessions and users

### Database Security

- Implement regular database backups
- Use connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Ensure database user has minimal required permissions

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly review security logs
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Subscribe to security advisories for used technologies

## Security Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements

- Multi-factor authentication implementation
- Enhanced audit logging
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Advanced rate limiting and bot protection
- Data encryption at rest for all sensitive data

### Security Maturity Model

The application security follows a progressive maturity model:

1. **Basic Security**: Authentication, HTTPS, input validation
2. **Enhanced Security**: Role-based access, API security, security headers
3. **Advanced Security**: Comprehensive logging, intrusion detection, regular security testing
4. **Proactive Security**: Threat modeling, security automation, continuous monitoring

The current implementation covers levels 1 and 2, with ongoing work toward levels 3 and 4.
