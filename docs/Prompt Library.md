## System Prompts

System prompts provide overall guidance to the AI model about its role, capabilities, and constraints. These prompts are sent at the beginning of each conversation to establish the context.

### Base System Prompt

The base system prompt defines the AI assistant's personality, capabilities, and limitations:

```typescript
const baseSystemPrompt = `You are a helpful AI assistant that can generate text, code, and images.
You have access to various tools to help users with their tasks.
Always be respectful, helpful, and concise in your responses.
If you don't know something, admit it rather than making up information.
`;
```

### Context-Aware Prompts

The application uses dynamic system prompts that adapt based on the context:

```typescript
export function systemPrompt({ selectedChatModel }: { selectedChatModel: string }) {
  // Base instructions for all models
  let prompt = baseSystemPrompt;
  
  // Add model-specific instructions
  if (selectedChatModel === 'chat-model-reasoning') {
    prompt += reasoningInstructions;
  } else {
    prompt += toolInstructions;
  }
  
  return prompt;
}
```

## Model-Specific Prompts

Different AI models require specific prompting strategies to leverage their unique capabilities.

### Reasoning Model Prompt

The reasoning model is instructed to show its thinking process:

```typescript
const reasoningInstructions = `
When answering complex questions, show your reasoning step by step.
Use <think> tags to indicate your reasoning process.
Example:
<think>
Let me analyze this step by step:
1. First, I need to understand the question...
2. Then, I'll consider the relevant facts...
3. Finally, I can draw a conclusion...
</think>

After showing your reasoning, provide a clear and concise answer.
`;
```

### Tool-Enabled Model Prompt

Models with tool access are given instructions on how to use available tools:

```typescript
const toolInstructions = `
You have access to the following tools:
1. getWeather - Get current weather information for a location
2. createDocument - Create a new document with formatted content
3. updateDocument - Update an existing document
4. requestSuggestions - Get content improvement suggestions

When a user's request requires using a tool:
1. Determine which tool is appropriate
2. Use the tool with the necessary parameters
3. Incorporate the tool's response into your answer

Always inform the user when you're using a tool to fulfill their request.
`;
```

### Title Generation Prompt

The title model uses a specialized prompt for generating chat titles:

```typescript
export const titleGenerationPrompt = `
Generate a short, descriptive title (4-6 words) for this conversation based on the user's message.
The title should capture the main topic or question.
Do not use quotes or special formatting in the title.
Respond with ONLY the title text.
`;
```

## Tool Instructions

Each tool has specific instructions to guide the AI in its proper use.

### Weather Tool Instructions

```typescript
export const weatherToolInstructions = `
To get weather information, you need a location parameter.
The location should be a city name, possibly with state/country for clarity.
Example usage: getWeather({ location: "San Francisco, CA" })
`;
```

### Document Creation Instructions

```typescript
export const documentCreationInstructions = `
To create a document, you need:
- title: A descriptive title for the document
- content: The formatted content (supports markdown)
- type: The document type (text, code, sheet)

Example usage: createDocument({ 
  title: "Meeting Notes", 
  content: "# Meeting Notes\n\n- Discussion points...", 
  type: "text" 
})
`;
```

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

The application employs several prompt engineering techniques to improve AI responses.

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

For complex reasoning tasks, the application uses chain-of-thought prompting:

```typescript
export const chainOfThoughtPrompt = `
Break down your thinking process step by step:
1. First, understand what is being asked
2. Identify the key information needed
3. Consider different approaches
4. Evaluate each approach
5. Choose the best approach and explain why
6. Provide your final answer
`;
```

### Few-Shot Examples

For specific tasks, the application provides examples to guide the model:

```typescript
export const fewShotCodeGenerationPrompt = `
When generating code, follow these examples:

User: Create a function to calculate factorial
Assistant: Here's a factorial function in JavaScript:
\`\`\`javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
\`\`\`

User: Write a Python class for a simple bank account
Assistant: Here's a Python class for a bank account:
\`\`\`python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance
        
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            return True
        return False
        
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            return True
        return False
        
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance
\`\`\`
`;
```

### Structured Output Formatting

For consistent output formatting:

```typescript
export const structuredOutputPrompt = `
When providing structured information, use this format:

Title: [Main Topic]
Summary: [Brief overview in 1-2 sentences]
Details:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]
Conclusion: [Final thoughts or recommendation]
`;
```

## Customizing Prompts

The application allows for prompt customization in several ways:

### Environment Variables

System prompts can be customized through environment variables:

```
CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT="Your custom system prompt here"
CUSTOM_REASONING_INSTRUCTIONS="Your custom reasoning instructions"
```

### Dynamic Prompt Construction

Prompts are constructed dynamically based on user context and selected model:

```typescript
function buildCustomPrompt(user, model, context) {
  let prompt = baseSystemPrompt;
  
  // Add user-specific customizations
  if (user.preferences.formality === 'formal') {
    prompt += formalToneInstructions;
  } else {
    prompt += conversationalToneInstructions;
  }
  
  // Add model-specific instructions
  if (model === 'chat-model-reasoning') {
    prompt += reasoningInstructions;
  } else if (model === 'artifact-model') {
    prompt += artifactGenerationInstructions;
  }
  
  // Add context-specific instructions
  if (context.includes('code')) {
    prompt += codeGenerationInstructions;
  }
  
  return prompt;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Design Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the expected behavior and output format
2. **Be Concise**: Keep instructions clear and to the point
3. **Provide Examples**: Include examples for complex tasks
4. **Set Boundaries**: Define what the AI should and shouldn't do
5. **Layer Instructions**: Start with general guidance, then add specifics

### Prompt Testing and Iteration

The development process includes:

1. **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt variations
2. **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback on AI responses
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update prompts based on performance

### Prompt Versioning

The application maintains a version history of system prompts:

```typescript
const promptVersions = {
  v1: {
    base: "Original base prompt...",
    reasoning: "Original reasoning instructions...",
  },
  v2: {
    base: "Improved base prompt with better guidance...",
    reasoning: "Enhanced reasoning instructions with examples...",
  },
  current: "v2" // Reference to current version
};
```
